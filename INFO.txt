WOW THANKS SB MOD UPLOADER FOR DELETING THE WORKSHOP DESCRIPTION

reincorporates the codexes from the beta versions of Starbound back into the game, tweaked to fit in alongside the current lore without losing too much of the feel of the Koala-era lore.





WOW THANKS SB MOD UPLOADER FOR DELETING THE OLD WORKSHOP DESCRIPTION

i've been playing Starbound since its days in early access. during that era, there was a TON of codexes you could find that painted a dark and mysterious side of Starbound's setting that was unfortunately lost in the road to the 1.0 release. the new codexes aren't bad, per se, but i did miss a lot of the mystery that was present in the beta codexes, as well as underlying stories that unfortunately didn't make it into release lore.

thankfully, modding can solve a bit of those things. :y

this mod is my attempt at reimplementing the Koala-era codexes into the game, albiet tweaked a little to fit the current lore. that means the Ring of Thorns isn't a thing, Greenfinger is referred to as a title rather than an individual name, and some stuff with Big Ape and the Miniknog is a bit different, alongside other things.

this is mostly for consistency's sake, and i understand that not a lot of people will like this change if you're a diehard legacy purist. additionally, a few of the more filler codexes were nixed from the mod, and there are a few cases of where i had to combine a few non-multipart codexes together and edit them to fit the change. for the most part, though, a lot of the text is the same, and i promise a lot of the meatier stuff made it in. c:

on the plus side, a lot of multi-part codexes are now combined into one book. they're a bit rare to find, but hey, no more multi-book hunting! c:

legacy codexes are a little less common than vanilla codexes, but they are marked with a yellow Starbound symbol in their title. they can be found in particular racial dungeons (currently, only avian, floran, and human codexes are available).

you can also spawn them in by using the admin command "/spawnitem CODEXNAME-codex"

credits to Ashton Raze for writing most of Starbound's lore during beta, and kudos to GonDragon for helping me with setting up treasure pools. edits and the mod itself were done by me.

adds ALL available codexes from my legacy lore mod to GonDragon's Bookstore mod. codexes will be found under the "Legacy" tab in the outpost bookstore.

you're obviously gonna need both mods for this to work.

i know there's already a R&C music replacer on the workshop, but i kinda prefer saving R&C's high-energy OST for missions rather than for exploring and just soaking up the atmosphere.
